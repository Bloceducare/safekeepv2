  "Supernet chains offer fast user experience with significantly lower gas fees in comparison to other existing L1s and L2s," said Sergey Gorbunov, co-founder of Axelar. "As a result of the partnership, users can easily move and use their currencies and NFTs across multiple Supernet chains, opening them up to the possibilities of a multichain Web3 ecosystem."

  Polygon Supernets are powered by Polygon Edge, a customizable blockchain stack for building networks fine-tuned to specific needs without compromising security and performance.
